## Notations
Re-vamp of an old React-based headless WordPress journaling application to work with Next.js 14, NextAuth 4, and WP GraphQL. It is a completely separate application that relies on WordPress for the pre-built GQL API and backend.

It is currently a work in progress for both design and code.

## A note on the WP backend
For this to work with your WP website, you will need to have installed and configured the following plugins: 
- WP GraphQL Plugin (https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
- WP GraphQL Upload Plugin (https://github.com/dre1080/wp-graphql-upload)
- WP GraphQL CORS plugin (https://github.com/funkhaus/wp-graphql-cors)
- WP GraphQL JWT Authentication (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication)

Also, note that for now, this is currently using custom mutations for uploading and setting a featured image outlined here:\

It also uses an additional post meta query field and update post meta mutation:

You also need to add theme and post format support:
```
add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'standard', 'link', 'image' ) );\
add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');\
add_post_type_support('post', 'thumbnail');
```

You will also need to add a private taxonomy for collections:
```
// Add custom collection taxonomy.
add_action( 'init', function() {
	$labels = array(
        'name'              => _x( 'Collections', 'taxonomy general name' ),
        'singular_name'     => _x( 'Collection', 'taxonomy singular name' ),
        'search_items'      => __( 'Search Collections' ),
        'all_items'         => __( 'All Collections' ),
        'parent_item'       => __( 'Parent Collection' ),
        'parent_item_colon' => __( 'Parent Collection:' ),
        'edit_item'         => __( 'Edit Collection' ),
        'update_item'       => __( 'Update Collection' ),
        'add_new_item'      => __( 'Add New Collection' ),
        'new_item_name'     => __( 'New Collection Name' ),
        'menu_name'         => __( 'Collections' ),
    );

    $args = array(
        'hierarchical'      => false,
        'labels'            => $labels,
        'show_ui'           => true,
        'show_admin_column' => true,
        'query_var'         => true,
        'show_in_graphql'   => true,
        'public'            => false,
        'graphql_single_name' => 'collection',
        'graphql_plural_name' => 'collections',
        'rewrite'           => array( 'slug' => 'collection' ),
    );

    register_taxonomy( 'collection', array( 'post' ), $args );

	// Add default bookmarks term.
    $bookmarks_term = term_exists( 'Bookmarks', 'collection' );
    if ( $bookmarks_term === 0 || $bookmarks_term === null ) {
        wp_insert_term(
            'Bookmarks',
            'collection',
            array(
                'slug' => 'bookmarks'
            )
        );
    }
});
```

## Getting Started

First, setup your env.local with the following values: 

NOTATIONS_GQL_URL={Your WP GraphQL endpoint}\
NOTATIONS_SECRET={Used for Next JWT signing - you can generate it at command line by running "openssl rand -base64 32"} and it is part of the JWT setup process.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
